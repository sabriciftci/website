abstract: In this book, we posit the existence of general socio-religious spatial positions with distinct outlooks within the domain of those generally categorized in public opinion research as “religious” Muslims.  Such a conceptual framework allows us to make an important contribution to the literature by moving away from instrumentation of religiosity along dichotomous binaries like “religious and non-religious” or “secular-Islamist” to better understand the religious and social roots of Muslim political attitudes. Inspired by the findings of social theory and the economics of religion literature, the book presents an argument based on the simple observation that significant intrafaith variation exists among the devout within a country. The book provides new conceptualization and theory about Muslim political attitudes. We apply the insights from distinct literatures including economics of religion, sociological theories on moral cosmology and religious identity, and the burgeoning empirical research on Muslim political attitudes to examine the synergies between religion and political/economic preferences.
