abstract: This book explores the lineages of political and social justice discourses to explain Muslim political attitudes. It combines historical and empirical treatments of the subject to provide a fuller account of the scholarly inquiry concerning “Islam and democracy.” It is not the first book to study this subject as numerous scholars looked into whether Islam as a major world religion is detrimental or favorable to democratic government. This study, however, brings new insights into this field in two ways. First, it focuses on Muslim agency and proposes that we should focus on “Muslims and democracy” rather than “Islam and democracy” to explain democratic leanings among the devout. Second, it explains Muslim political attitudes from a novel perspective by putting values at the center of its inquiry. One of the assumptions of this volume is that justice is the most significant value in Islam’s ethico-political system. For that reason, it is proposed that different conceptions of justice have significant sway on political attitudes of the devout.
