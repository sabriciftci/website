2021 Israeli-Palestinian Crisis is the latest manifestation of Israel's unilateral policies that is now characterized as an **apartheid** regime. Years of chronic conflict, repression, and injustices culminated into the total marginalization of Palestinian people, absolute lack of respect for their self-determination right, and near-complete occupation of their homeland by militaristic and settlement campaigns. Palestine, especially, Gaza has become **District 9**. There are thousands of articles, blogs, and opinion pieces about the latest escalation following Israeli Supreme court's decision to evict four Palestinian families from Sheikh Jarrah neighborhood in East Jerusalem. The rest is, unfortunately, a familiar story of disproportional use of force by Israel, killing of civilians, grave injustices, and urban violence amid a new **Intifada**,  rising **extremism of radical Jewish groups**, and indifference of international community to the unfolding drama.  I am not an expert on Israeli politics nor I study the chronic conflict in this part of the world. So, I will refer the readers to thousands of pieces written by scholars and and pundits about the subject (I am refraining to endorse any).  In this post, I would like to provide some data and insights about Israel's long-term policy of gaining official recognition. My main argument is this: official recognition is not simply a symbolic, diplomatic act. Rather it comes with significant perks, including lucrative trade relations, security benefits, and creation of a _parallel_ _universe_ _of_ _legitimacy_ justifying acts of State of Israel despite grave injustices, human rights violations, and war crimes. Let me start with this twitter post by Benjamin Netanyahu highlighting the official support Israel enjoys (tweet intentionally not embedded!!!).


Most of these countries whose flags are shown on this tweet recognize Israel but not Palestine. Here is your first perk of official recognition game. Call on or cite the countries that recognize Israel but not Palestine in your public messages to create a false legitimacy in a parallel universe. The people of the countries whose flags are listed in this tweet do not necessarily endorse their government's position as there is generally a good deal of support for Palestinian independence. For example, in the latest escalation, significant protests took place in London, New York, Chicago, and even Tel Aviv against violence carried by the state of Israel. Yet, I don't think the respective governments or Netanyahu cares about these protests. The state of Israel was created on 14 May 1948 and quickly recognized by some Western countries. Over time, this recognition expanded as this map shows (I used [rworldmap](https://github.com/AndySouth/rworldmap/) package by Andy South to produce these maps):
